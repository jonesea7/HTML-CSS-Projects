	Assignment Objectives:
		1. href Basic_CSS_2 file to add styling to a paragraph
		2. define term 'entity'
			An entity in html is a symbol that means something specific in a specific coding language. For example:
				The "<" and ">" are used to create tags in html. If one were to simply write these into the script
				the result might be a confused browser that thinks you wrote a half-ass tag as opposed to you simply
				wanting to use the lesser than symbol in text.
		3. Use an entity number to add a character to the code below.
