I say all that to say, I genuinely care about these brands (both Innocean and Hyundai). Innocean for its awarding-winning approach to marketing, and Hyundai for being pretty much awesome at whatever we decide to make. I drive a Hyundai. I wear Hyundai branded t-shirts. I use the royal &ldquo;We&rdquo; when I talk about Hyundai. I&rsquo;ve gotten into K-Pop because of Hyundai. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">Basically, I&rsquo;m in.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">This seems to be the best opportunity for me to express my potential in the foreseeable future and I intend to take advantage of it all.</span></p><p class="c1 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.8nfsomjdo77u"><span class="c5">On The Floor, In the Trenches</span></h3><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day flew by.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in what Csikszentmihalyi would call </span><span class="c2">Flow</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was well rested, my answers were on point, and we smashed our numbers for </span><span class="c2">Hyundai</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Swag</span><span>&nbsp;(an exciting game show sponsored by Hyundai, you might have heard of it I&rsquo;m sure). I felt so good that I stayed out on the floor (I am allowed a bit of a break between shows at Majors) just to express my excitement about the</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Hyundai Nexo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the skeptical but intrigued public of New York City. The day seemed to be over too soon. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">The highlight was being reunited on the show with a couple who had done the game show two years earlier. We expressed our joy of the memory (thanks to Instagram) and marveled over how time passed so quickly. People remembered me, sought me, and wanted to come thank me for their experiences at the Hyundai display.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">That was this past April.

But I knew the best way I could honor my Pops was to work to the best of my ability. He was a working man, and he would have kicked my ass if he knew I didn&rsquo;t go to work on the count of him.

I guess my first knee-jerk reaction is to have a heart-to-heart with them if they were to ever do something uncouth to make sure I&rsquo;m not missing something or misunderstanding their actions. If there is a sincere violation of policy, I guessed I&rsquo;d write an official complaint via email for the purpose of a paper trail after confronting the offender privately first (again to make sure I&rsquo;m not off base). </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span>I truly believe the culture of our team would prohibit anyone from intentionally doing wrong. To be frank, because of this belief I could write you a bunch of stuff of what I would or could do, but I&rsquo;d truly have to cross that bridge if I got there. I hope I </span><span class="c2">never</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;set foot on said bridge, though.</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.yr9d60qlmrhp"><span class="c5">Candor</span></h3><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I consider the prospect of being a TL there are still a few reservations. Most of it stems from my being the </span><span class="c2">SWAG</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;host. Never have I had a job that took full advantage of who I am as a person, performer, and information monger than Hyundai SWAG. I fear leaving SWAG to be a TL would be off somehow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think of the ideal TL, I envision going to an auto show (as a PS) and not being aware that anything is even wrong. The great TLs are so quick at anticipating problems and solving them that I hardly notice any issues. My attention to detail would have to take on a incredible upgrade to achieve such prowess and ability.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been an assistant director of a theatre, managed numerous retail stores, founded and ran an entertainment company, and am currently serving my long tenure as a father. Adversity, bad behavior discussions, disappointment, and improvisation out of issues are all part of my DNA now. My ONLY reservation about all of this is simply: </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span>Will I enjoy it as much as </span><span class="c2">SWAG</span><span class="c0">?</span></p><p class="c1 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">Will I do my best? Of course.</span></p><p class="c1 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">Can I do the job? I truly believe so!</span></p><p class="c1 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">Can I glean from my mentors who are doing great work already? That&rsquo;s what I do.</span></p><p class="c1 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">Can I encourage others to approach the work with my same zeal and enthusiasm? </span></p><p class="c1 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">I hope so.</span></p><p class="c1 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">My greatest concern in getting joy out of the experience completely. Moreover, I feel like my style of &lsquo;leadership&rsquo; works best when I am not a &lsquo;leader&rsquo;. Sometimes you just need somebody who is part of the team to do it right, and hope that it rubs off on everyone else. I believe (at least I truly hope) that I am that PS. I strive to be the PS that other PS look up to and say to themselves: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how you do the job!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.99t71agg8gwb"><span class="c5">WHAT I&rsquo;VE GOT IS HEART</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can expect from me heart. I will go full tilt and give you my best version of me for that day. I&rsquo;m not perfect, but I control what I can as much as I can. I am professional. Virtually always early. I rarely complain, and I ceaselessly smile. I move through my zone like a shark in water, because being still and not engaging is death to me. I am passionate, sincerely passionate about the brand (I talk about it to anyone who will listen). I am so grateful and therefore so hungry to do a great job. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This job is in the top five of best things that have ever happen to me! This opportunity is the number one reason that when people ask me how I&rsquo;m doing, I answer &ldquo;Better than I deserve.&rdquo; I love the people I work with and so as a leader I will give them my heart, my ear, and every chance possible for </span><span class="c2">them</span><span>&nbsp;to be successful. I want to be synonymous with the Hyundai Product Specialist Team. I want to be so consistent that it can almost be taken for granted that my crew will do well. When something awesome needs to be accomplished I want to </span><span class="c2">my</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">name</span><span>&nbsp;to pop into </span><span class="c2">your</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;head.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, I want to do what is best for the team. I want to be fairly compensated too. But, I want my talents to be used well to make our team the best version of itself, with me playing whatever role makes us look good.</span></p><div><p class="c4 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
